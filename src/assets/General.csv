SOLID,solid principle principles,<i>Single Responsibility</i> - class/component should have only one responsibility.<br><br><i>Open/Closed</i> - classes should be open for extension but closed for modification. E.g. we should avoid modifying existing code and causing potential new bugs.<br><br><i>Liskov Substitution</i> - if class A is subtype of class B we should be able to replace B with A without disrupting the behavior of our program.<br><br><i>Interface Segregation</i> - larger interfaces should be split into smaller ones so we can ensure that implementing classes only need to be concerned about the methods that are of interest to them.<br><br><i>Dependency Inversion</i> refers to decoupling of software modules e.g. instead of high-level modules depending on low-level modules both will depend on abstractions. Great example here is <i>Dependency Injection</i> pattern which allows to use dependencies without the knowledge about their instantiations.

Critical rendering path,critical rendering path,<i>CRP</i> - sequence of steps the browser goes through to convert the HTML CSS and JavaScript into pixels on the screen.<br><br>HTML is being parsed to create DOM. HTML may request JavaScript which may alter the DOM. HTML includes or makes requests for styles; the CSS object model is being built. The browser engine combines DOM and CSSOM to create Render Tree. Layout determines the size and location of everything on the page. Once layout is determined pixels are painted on the screen.
