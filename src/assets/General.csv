SOLID,solid principle principles,<i>Single Responsibility</i> - class/component should have only one responsibility.<br><i>Open/Closed</i> - classes should be open for extension but closed for modification. E.g. we should avoid modifying existing code and causing potential new bugs.<br><i>Liskov Substitution</i> - if class A is subtype of class B we should be able to replace B with A without disrupting the behavior of our program.<br><i>Interface Segregation</i> - larger interfaces should be split into smaller ones so we can ensure that implementing classes only need to be concerned about the methods that are of interest to them.<br><i>Dependency Inversion</i> refers to decoupling of software modules e.g. instead of high-level modules depending on low-level modules both will depend on abstractions. Great example here is <i>Dependency Injection</i> pattern which allows to use dependencies without the knowledge about their instantiations.
Design patterns,design pattern patterns,<i>Singleton</i> - only one instance of class is possible.<br><i>Factory</i> - method that creates objects of type.<br><i>Iterator</i> - providing an API to loop over and navigate around a complex custom data structure.<br><i>Decorator</i> - tweaking objects at runtime by adding functionality from predefined decorator objects.<br><i>Observer</i> - loose coupling by creating <i>observable</i> objects that notify all their <i>observers</i> when an interesting event occurs (<i>on-push</i> notification strategy).<br><i>Strategy</i> - keeping the same interface while selecting the best strategy to handle the specific task (context).<br><i>Facade</i> - Providing a more convenient API by wrapping common (or poorly designed) methods into a new one.<br><i>Proxy</i> - wrapping an object to control the access to it with the goal of avoiding expensive operations by either grouping them together or performing them only when really necessary.
Functional programming,functional programming pure function,1. <i>Pure function</i> - function with no side effects; with the given input gives the same output.<br>2. <i>High order function</i> - a function that takes a function as an argument or returns a function.<br>3. <i>Functions as first-class objects</i> - functions can be assigned as variable or assigned to object property values.<br>4. <i>Carrying</i> - technique of translating the evaluation of a function that takes multiple arguments into evaluating a sequence of functions each with a single argument.<br>5. <i>Immutable variables</i> - immutable objects are objects whose state cannot be changed after declaration.
Sending request in browser,sending send request browser rendering render,1. Browser goes to the Domain Name System (DNS) server and finds the real address of the server that the website lives on.<br>2. Browser sends an HTTP request to server asking it to send a copy of the website to the client.<br>3. If the server approves the client's request the server sends the client a "200 OK" message and then starts sending the website's files to the browser as a series of small chunks called data packets.<br>4. Critical rendering path - browser assembles the small chunks into a complete web page and displays it to the user.
Critical rendering path,critical rendering render path sending send request browser,<i>CRP</i> - sequence of steps the browser goes through to convert the HTML CSS and JavaScript into pixels on the screen.<br><br>HTML is being parsed to create DOM. HTML may request JavaScript which may alter the DOM. HTML includes or makes requests for styles; the CSS object model is being built. The browser engine combines DOM and CSSOM to create Render Tree. Layout determines the size and location of everything on the page. Once layout is determined pixels are painted on the screen.
defer vs async,defer async,<i>Defer</i> - means execute code after it's downloaded and browser finished DOM construction and rendering process. Used for scripts that need the whole DOM.<br><br><i>Async</i> - means execute code when it is downloaded and do not block DOM construction during downloading process. Used for independent scripts like counters or ads.
